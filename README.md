#游늵 **Computational Number Theory & Performance Analysis**

##Overview

This project is a comprehensive collection of Python functions implemented within a single Jupyter Notebook (ProgramCodes.ipynb). It serves as a computational library focusing primarily on Number Theory (primes, factorization, divisibility, properties of numbers) and Advanced Computational Mathematics (sequences, modular arithmetic, approximations).

The primary goal is to provide runnable, self-contained implementations of these mathematical concepts, with a strong emphasis on measuring and analyzing algorithmic performance. Each function is instrumented using Python's built-in time and tracemalloc modules to calculate Execution Time and Peak Memory Usage, offering basic, yet crucial, insights into the efficiency of each algorithm.
